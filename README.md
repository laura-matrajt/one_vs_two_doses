## Abstract

Most COVID-19 vaccines require two doses, however with limited vaccine supply, policymakers are considering single-dose 
vaccination as an alternative strategy. Using a mathematical model combined with optimization algorithms, we determined 
optimal allocation strategies with one and two doses of vaccine under various degrees of viral transmission. 
Under low transmission, we show that the optimal allocation of vaccine vitally depends on the single-dose efficacy. 
With high single-dose efficacy, single-dose vaccination is optimal, preventing up to 22% more deaths than a strategy 
prioritizing two-dose vaccination for older adults. With low or moderate single-dose efficacy, mixed vaccination 
campaigns with complete coverage of older adults are optimal. However, with modest or high transmission, vaccinating 
older adults first with two doses is best, preventing up to 41% more deaths than a single-dose vaccination given across 
all adult populations. Our work suggests that it is imperative to determine the efficacy and durability of single-dose 
vaccines, as mixed or single-dose vaccination campaigns may have the potential to contain the pandemic much more quickly.
